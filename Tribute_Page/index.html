      <p>The best way to describe Bob is passionate. Whatever he did, he sunk his heart into to it and ended up impacting those around him. Whether you were watching
      him on TV or listening to him in a podcast, he had clearly mastered the art of communication. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <p>During his comedy routines, he had no problem speaking what was on his mind. Many of his jokes come from real world problems and things he'd faced in his
      lifetime. Given his Jewish background, many of the jokes made light of his childhood and how the traditions of the religion affected him.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <p>Bob was mostly known for his role in <i>Full House</i> and <i>America's Funniest Home Videos</i>.
      As a widowed dad in <i>Full House</i>, the audience grew to know him as a family guy and connected so well with him that when he came back for <i>Fuller House</i>,
      it was almost as if he never left.</p>
